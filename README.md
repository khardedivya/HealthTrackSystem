# HealthTrackSystem
Represent vital Signs

## Purpose of the Project
The HealthTrackSystem project is designed to monitor and track vital signs of patients in real-time. It aims to provide healthcare professionals with a reliable system to monitor parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and oxygen saturation. By utilizing C language, the project ensures efficient and low-level access to hardware, making it suitable for embedded systems and medical devices.

## How to Use
### Requirements
- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Operating system compatible with C programs

## Additional Information
- The project is written in C language, providing efficiency and low-level access to hardware.
- It allows for real-time monitoring of vital signs, making it suitable for medical devices and embedded systems.
- Future enhancements may include support for additional sensors, improved user interface, and integration with healthcare databases.
- Please ensure compliance with medical regulations and ethical considerations when using or modifying this project for medical purposes.
